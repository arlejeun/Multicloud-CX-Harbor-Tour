## Designer Analytics

Designer Analytics is a powerful tool that provides a rich overview of your contact center operations. It features a series of informative dashboards, each of which offers a variety of visualizations and in-depth reporting panels that highlight specific aspects of your operations.

You can track calling trends, monitor how callers are interacting with the applications, and quickly notice and react to any potential issues with the applications or system platform. It can quickly answer questions you might have about your operations, such as:

How long are customers waiting for an agent?
How many customer interactions did we receive yesterday? Last week? Last month?
How many of our customers are contacting us from North America? Europe? Asia?
Key features:

- Almost real-time reporting means that as soon as an application session ends, Designer Analytics starts using the data to build reports.
Important
- 90-day data retention, so you can see how your applications are performing over time.
- Advanced filtering options, so you can focus on the data you want to see.
