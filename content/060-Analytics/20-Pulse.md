## Pulse


To access Pulse, make sure to click on the Pulse Reporting tile of the Genesys Portal and log in with your own EOD Personal admin user.

Once logged in for the first time, your workspace have no dedicated dashboard or wallboard.

You can create your own dashboard or wallboard from blank or you can add one from an existing template. We created one template of each to help you create a wallboard or dashboard.

- Open EOD Realtime Azure Dashboard and it will create a copy in your workspace
- Changes will be restricted to your user

The dashboard will be rendered into your workspace. You might have to select your own objects from the dashboard by editing the widgets if you don't see any object in the configured widget
