## Notes

Platform stability

This Azure EOD is a production tenant on the Genesys Engage Cloud platform.  The availability of the platform and components is managed by the DevOps cloud team, therefore  we are not responsible for the service level and availability of the platform.

Application cache in Designer 

To speed up the availability of a change you made in a Designer application, we recommend to follow these steps:

Save your application by using the [Save Flow] button
Create a new build for your application by using the [Build] button, then enter a Label, then hit [Build]
Go back to the list of applications
Select the line with your application
Select the active stream
Click on Builds and select your new build
If you use the default method (Latest Published), you will instead have to wait for several minutes until your latest changes are live.
